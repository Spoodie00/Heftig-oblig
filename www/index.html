            <p>This is a placeholder. If you feel like an extra challenge you may 
                want to implement a fully fledged web application that uses the REST API 
                that you just have developed. Most modern web applications combine HTML, CSS 
                and JavaScript to create something called a <em>Single Page Application (SPA)</em>.
                JavaScript is in some sense similar to Python in the sense that it is also 
                a dynamically typed and interpreted language. A good starting point for learning 
                JavaScript and Web Development in general are the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Guides</a>. Additionally, people often use some kind of
                a framwork to set up their application. Some popular examples are:</p>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="https://angular.io/">Anular</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Or you may use a traditional backend-driven rendering mechanism by leveraging <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#htmlresponse">FastAPI's <code>HTMLResponse</code></a> and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>.</p>
